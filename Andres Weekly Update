Week of 09/04: Validation of subsystem from last semster, revise pcb design and submit Advance pcb for implementation. Prepare
presentation and stablish plan for subsystem integration
Week of 09/04: PCB designn was finalized and submitted to edc for fabrication, after prototype is delivered initial suttering and integartion will be perform
Week of 09/26: PCB order got delayes due to pcb not fabircating the order. PCB was optimized based on Dr. Lusher Instructions.
Week of 10/03: PCB could not be fabricated due to limitation in the manufactring capabilities of the the edc. So design was usbmitted to 3rd pary website, intgration planing was started.
Week of 10/10: PCB was recieved and part were soldered to the board, opartion is not functionaly so cuntinuity and logic testing needs to be performed 
Week of 10/17: After performing logic and continuity test designed flaws were identified and fixed. Validation was started, however when one of the
test was about to be run a user error ocurred. The Ref voltage of the pcb was ran with 14V by mistake which led to the lack of functionlaity of the IR sensors.
New IR sensors have been ordered and will be implemeneted next week.
Week of 10/24: Sensors recived and implemeneted, individual validation of each of the sensors started and planed to be achieved by next week.
Week of 10/31: Individual validation has been achieved and integration with MCU started.
Week of 11/07: Some intagration issues ocurred with MCU due to design flws in the PMIC board design, should be corrected and impleneted by next week
Week of 11/14: Full integartion with MCU achieved complete system validation started.
Week of 11/21: System validated and standar wall power source circuitry was implenented (120V, 60Hz). VPS video recorded and sumitted
Week of 11/24: Final preparaion for final demo done and system was demoed.
